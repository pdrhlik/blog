## Contact

If you want to know something more about me or my work, don't hesitate to contact me. I prefer email communication but don't really mind anything else.

**LinkedIn** is a good way to see my education, work experience or other achievements like certificates.

**GitHub** is a showcase of some code I write. This whole blog is there as a repository too. I have most of my projects hosted privately on BitBucket but I hope to continuously change that.

Although I have a **Twitter** for a while now, I'm still very new to it. I actually only tweeted once in my life! I'll change that too because I would like to share my work/articles through it.

This one is pretty self-explanatory. Everybody has an email nowadays, right?
