## Welcome!

Welcome to my blog site! My name is Patrik Drhlík but my nickname has been Patrio Scraper for quite a long time. That's the reason for the blog domain name. It might seem strange but I wanted to come up with something that is based on my own name and had an english feel. Scraper is a very rough translation of my last name so there's that.

I've had this domain for quite some time but I have been facing a lack of motivation to use it and start writing anything. This changed at the begininng of this week when I attended the [Why R? 2018 conference](http://whyr2018.pl/) in Wrocław. I gave my very first talk there in front of quite a few people. It was just a lightning talk but I really enjoyed it! Surprisingly, I also got an amazing feedback not just from the organizers but from lots of the attendees as well. It was about a South Park text analysis. I'll be writing a separate blog post about this. You can check the [lightning talk repository](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparktalk-whyr2018) or the [R package](https://github.com/pdrhlik/southparkr) that contains all the code to scrape and parse all the data that was used for the analysis.

## See you around

I have a few projects that I work on and I would definitely like to get them anywhere outside my computer. Finally! Let's hope I'll find the motivation and time to do so. Right now, I'm very excited about it all of this.
