## About me, professionally

I'll just tell you a bit here. You can find more details on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrik-drhlik/).

My name is Patrik Drhlík and I consider myself to be a data scientist. I gained my Master's degree at the [Technical University of Liberec](https://www.tul.cz/en/), Czech Republic, in Computer science. I am currently pursuing my PhD at the same university and I'm also doing some freelancing.

I mostly work with R, analysing data. But I have a very strong background in web and database development.

I am always open to new and exciting opportunities!

## About me, personally

I am a **father** and a **husband** to my two amazing girls! I used to be an **athlete** and 400 metres was my discipline. My personal best is 48.71 s and I still love to watch athletics whenever there is a race on TV. I am a passionate **Rubik's cube solver**. I can solve cubes from 2x2x2 up to 5x5x5. My 3x3x3 personal best is 40 seconds and I can even solve 2x2x2 blindfolded. I am a **hitchhiker** that enjoys the company of strangers. I am a **hiker** who loves mountains and sunsets. I am a **geocacher**, finding hidden treasures has always been my thing. I became a **kangaroo and koala lover** after living in Australia. And I am also a **beer lover** but if you know Czech people, this shouldn't surprise you too much.

Photos coming soon.
